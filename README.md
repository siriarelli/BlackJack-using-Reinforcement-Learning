# BlackJack-using-Reinforcement-Learning
In this project, Monte Carlo Prediction Simulation has been used on Blackjack environment of the GYM library .

## Two types of opponents: 
### ➢ Player
### ➢ Dealer

## Winning criteria:
Player should have sum of the cards either equal to 21 or greater than the sum of the cards value of dealer but it should not exceeds 21.

## Car Values:
• ThevaluesofthecardsJack(J),King(K),andQueen (Q) will be considered as 10.
• The value of the Ace (A) can be 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice. That is, the player can decide whether the value of an Ace should be 1 or 11 during the game.
• Thevalueoftherestofthecards(2to10)isjusttheir face value.
